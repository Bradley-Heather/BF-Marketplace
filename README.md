## Brief descrtiption of current MVP 
Trusted developers or property owners may mint a fixed number of 'Property Tokens' to represent the real world value of a property. This is a one shot policy locked via the consumption of a eUTXO to ensure no additional tokens can ever enter the market. These Tokens may then be listed on the Bora marketplace and sold to investors.

**Users categories** <br />
Bora Marketplace - Run by the BoraMarket smart contract <br />
Property developer/owner - Trusted party that is given the permision to mint and list property tokens <br />

**Monetization** <br />
